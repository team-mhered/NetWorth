# Net worth tracker

Project for the [Agile development course](https://jj.github.io/curso-tdd)

The template contains the bare minimum needed to start a project, including a 
GitHub action that checks the presence of certain files, a folder for tests and 
another for documentation.

Personalizable web app to automate the collection of updated information from 
different sources (bank accounts, pensions, funds, stock, crypto, real state, etc) 
to generate estimates of net worth over time.
